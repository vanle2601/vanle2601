Hi I'm Van 👋

Welcome to Van's profile! 
Van is a passionate Front End dev that highkey fangirls to new UX/ UI libraries, tech talks, building application and just general human's ideas. Like recently I've
got talked to follow this guy who can talk backwards:)

🤔 Little things I love besides coding probably are {
animals: CATS 🐈,
drinks: coffee/ protein shake 🧊☕, 
guilty pleasures: binging Modern Family (Phil is my fav) while eating 🎥, 
gym: hitting PR on bench press (because how it really humbles me everytime) 🏋️,
music: useEffect(() => {
    fetch("https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-tIS2zYze5xcFSqaQNyU6m8XzQX70Ii0")
    .then(response => response.json()
    .then(data => setPlaylist(data.Playlist))
  },[]) */seriously, check out that link!*/
}

Sorry bit off topic. Back to serious business 💼 {
languages I love: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
framework: React, basic Vue
libraries: MUI, Redux, Axios, and etc
NPM packages: Oh numerous, I love installing package and see how it heavily saves my time! 
}
