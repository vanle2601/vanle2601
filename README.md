### Hi! I'm Van 👋

Welcome to Van's profile! 
Van is a passionate Front End dev that highkey fangirls to new UX/ UI libraries, tech talks, building application and just general human's ideas.

Back to serious business 💼 {
- languages I love: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- framework: React, basic Vue
- libraries: MUI, Redux, Axios, and etc
- NPM packages: Oh numerous, I love installing packages and see how it heavily saves my time! 
}

🤔 Little things I love besides coding probably are {
- animals: CATS 🐈,
- drinks: coffee/ protein shake (honeycomb best flavour) 🧊☕, 
- guilty pleasures: binging Modern Family (Phil is my fav) while eating 🎥,
- music: useEffect(() => {
    fetch("https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-tIS2zYze5xcFSqaQNyU6m8XzQX70Ii0")
    .then(response => response.json()
    .then(data => setPlaylist(data.Playlist))
  },[]) */seriously, check out that link!*/
